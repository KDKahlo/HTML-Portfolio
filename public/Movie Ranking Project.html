<h1>The Best Movies Ever According to KD</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time...</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Encanto</h3>
<p>This movie invokes a full range of emotions from laughter, to tears, to fear and so much more. It shows a culture so rarely represented in films and it is fun for the whole family. The kids won't be the only ones bouncing in their seats or swing their hips. Guaranteed!</p>
<h3>Captain Marvel</h3>
<p>By far one of the most amazing female hero representations. I'm a huge Wonder Woman fan, but Captain Marvel gave me a whole new appreciation for female superheroes. She is someone everyone will root for and it gives you a glimpse back to the Avengers beginnings. Can't beat that.</p>
<h3>The Wedding Ringer</h3>
<p>Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart. This movie made me laugh til my sides hurts. I think that says it all. Watch It!!</p>
